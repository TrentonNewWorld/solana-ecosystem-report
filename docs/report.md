## At a glance

- The network is processing **2,691 non-vote TPS** (5,170 TPS including consensus votes) over the last 60.0 minutes, at a mean slot time of **0.271s**.
- **675 active validators** (10 delinquent, holding 0.008% of stake). It takes **18 validators** to control a third of stake — the liveness-halting threshold.
- **SOL at $121.98** (+3.82% over 24h), market cap $71.68B.
- **DeFi TVL $6.64B** (+5.31% 7d, +14.76% 30d), against $16.64B of stablecoins settled on Solana.
- **$2.80B of DEX volume in 24h** across 125 protocols, generating $14.94M in fees.

## Protocol roadmap

Read from the source of record rather than a hand-kept list, so it stays correct without anyone maintaining it: open pull requests against the Solana Improvement Documents repo are what the protocol is being *asked* to change, and Agave releases are what validators are actually being asked to *run*.

## Data sources

| Source | Used for | Key required |
|---|---|---|
| `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` (Solana JSON-RPC) | epoch, slots, TPS, slot time, supply, validator set | no |
| CoinGecko public API | SOL price, market cap, spot volume | no |
| DeFiLlama | DeFi TVL (90d series), DEX volume, chain fees | no |
| DeFiLlama stablecoins | stablecoin supply settled on Solana, by peg | no |
| GitHub public API | open SIMD proposals, Agave validator client releases | no |

Every request is a plain HTTPS GET/POST from `urllib` in the Python standard library. There are no API keys, no accounts and no third-party packages, so the pipeline runs on a bare `python:3-slim` image or a GitHub Actions runner with no setup step.
